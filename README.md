This is a part of Cool R Things series made purely for educational purposes. Contains both .rmd file and the notebook.

In this series i demonstrate various things that R allows us to do from web scraping, building dashboards, creating maps and many more.

This project showcases the development of an interactive dashboard utilizing the powerful ```Shiny``` library in R. By leveraging the ```iris``` dataset from the ```datasets``` package, i explore its inherent patterns and characteristics through visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Throughout the project, i demonstrate ```data manipulation```, ```visualization``` and ```interactive dashboards```.
